# 2.6 .htaccess for History Mode

When using Vue Router you have 2 options for how the URL must look and behave, `history` mode and `hash` mode

When you use `hash` mode then the url will look something like this as you navigate the website: [http://securezone.dev.isa.co.za#Home](http://securezone.dev.isa.co.za#Home) or [http://securezone.dev.isa.co.za#dasboard](http://securezone.dev.isa.co.za#dasboard).
> Notice the #Home and #Dashboard

The Home and Dashboard is preceded with a `#`. That means that the website is still pointing to the `index.html` page but showing the page content for `home` or `dashboard`, hence the phrase SPA (Single page app).

But the whole hash thing is not the most beautiful so you can use `history` instead. Then the url's will look like this: [http://securezone.dev.isa.co.za/Home](http://securezone.dev.isa.co.za/Home) or [http://securezone.dev.isa.co.za/dasboard](http://securezone.dev.isa.co.za/dasboard).

But this means the the server will go and look for the `Home` folder on the server and that should contain an `index.html` file an a `dashboard` folder containing an `index.html` file.

To get around the we create a `.htaccess` file and put it in the folder for which it must apply and below, if you create another `htaccess` file in a folder below with the same setting is will override the settings.

```conf
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  # Catch all traffic and direct to index.html 
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]      
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f  # Except of the file actually exists
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d  # Except of the directory actually exists
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
