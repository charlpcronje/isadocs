# Policy Digitizer System for Caja Morelia Valladolid

Due to Caja Morelia's need to eliminate documents, it is requested to create a system that can digitize them so as not to lose access to them.

The system connects to a SQL Server 2008 database (which cannot be provided for security reasons) and stores the documents on the computer where it is run in PDF format, it allows modifying these PDFs with functions such as rotation and union with other documents.
