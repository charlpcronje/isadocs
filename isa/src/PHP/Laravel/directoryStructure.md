# [Directory Structure](#directories)

After installing the framework, take a glance around the project to familiarize yourself with the directory structure. The `app` directory contains folders such as `views`, `controllers`, and `models`. Most of your application's code will reside somewhere in this directory. You may also wish to explore the `app/config` directory and the configuration options that are available to you.
