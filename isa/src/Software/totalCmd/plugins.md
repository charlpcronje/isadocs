## 27. Virtual Disk 1.3.3 Final

This plugin allows to mount disk images as additional drives. It works only under systems Windows 2000 and higher (32/64-bit).
One can mount ISO- and some of BIN- and NRG-images of CD, and arbitrary image files that are recognised by Windows (FAT and NTFS), including IMG-files - floppy images. When an image is mounted, there is a new drive appears in the system. Its letter is specified earlier, and the new drive contains all the content of the image file. Three modes
are available:
  HDD - emulation of local hard disk drive.
  FDD - emulation of floppy drive.
  CD/DVD - CD-drive emulation (there is no difference between CD and DVD in the system).
Also there is the "Read only" modifier that allows to disable modifying of the image mounted. CD-drive emulation is always performed in Read-Only mode.

ATTENTION!!!
For the plugin to work it is needed to install the driver of the virtual drives (the "Install" command from the context menu of the file VD_Driver\vd_filedisk.inf).
In 64-bit Windows versions the driver installation must be performed from Windows Explorer or from TC 64-bit!

## 29. Branch View Extended 1.03

BranchViewExtended is similar to standard Branch View but shows also all nested directories with their sizes.

HOW TO USE.

You have to create button or start menu item with following parameters:

Command: cd
Parameters: \\\BranchViewEx\%p

Plugin works for current path, like standard Branch View.

WHY TO USE.

I use it when I need to quick-free some disk space. In this case I set sorting method "Sort by size" and run this plugin. With this plugin I can find not only needless huge files but also needless huge directories containing a lot of small files (that is why I can't find them with standard Branch view) and buried deeply in file system (that's why I can't find them manually).

Notes:
-- You cannot browse directories from this plugin.
-- You cannot start plugin directly from My Network Places.
-- This plugin shows directories as files with ./ extension (If you use color scheme for directories I recommend use this scheme for ./ files too).
-- This plugin doesn't follow symbolic links but shows them as directories (by the way you can browse them manually).
-- This plugin uses standard copying progress dialog to indicate progress.
