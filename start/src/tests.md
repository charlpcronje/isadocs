Broke up this documentation into 3 main parts

1. `Secure Zone`, The project was really just to bind some cliets to a user, I ot the feeling it was more to get me familiar with the idea and to make me think of how an application like this should be approached.
2. `Pulse Development`, this includes building a new Pulse server, adding a new appliance ad creating a new server side agent.
3. `General Documentation`, it is about everything that I did not find obvious and that would have saved me some time if I id know these things or had some kind of reference to go look up
